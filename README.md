## About The Project

### Purpose
I am building this project to end my journey of learning rust. I contemplated what I should do after doing the exercism track for rust and I had the choice of either building a console application, a desktop application, a game, a full stack website or a mobile app. I already attempted to build a mobile app in another project, and now I decided to take on this project. 
The tutorial I am following, which will be linked in the acknowledgements at the end of this README, describes how I could post this to a website. In the tutorial, I would be building console applications, a desktop GUI and I would be able to port this to be hosted on a website all by creating this game.
Due to the numerous chapters of this tutorial, it will probably take me several hours/live streams, which will result on me working on developing this game over some weeks.
### Benefits
By creating this game, I hope to develop my rust knowledge, which will hopefully make me a better programmer in the future by helping me become more familiar with low level systems programming. By acquiring this knowledge, I will be able to adapt these teachings to the code I develop in the future, which will hopefully help me become a better programmer.
### Implementation Method
For each chapter I complete, I will be opening a new PR and working on a separate branch from the master branch. There are 2 benefits to doing this:
1. By working in this way, I will be reflecting a real development environment where code isn't pushed to the master branch but must first go through a PR and would undergo a code review
2. For individuals that look at the history of this codebase, it will be easier to identify the areas associated with each chapter, which may be more helpful.

However, there are some downsides to this approach:
1. As I am reviewing my own code, there wouldn't be any improvement in code quality unless I physically notice this myself
2. No tests would be implemented unless the tutorial has specified that a test is necessary for a specific piece of code which may break the master branch.

If anybody wants to help improve the quality of the code written in this repository, please feel free to open an issue to become a code reviewer or a PR for unit tests if I haven't made any.
### Timeline
There are four chapters of the tutorial, so I expect to have finished the tutorial in four weeks. As I am working, I will only be able to contribute to this repository over the weekends, which is why I will only accept issues or PRs after I have finished implementing all the chapters from the tutorial.
### Expected Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, I hope I am able to understand rust better, become a better programmer and that the game is in a functioning state.
